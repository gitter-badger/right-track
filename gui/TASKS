---- To Do ----

Draw names in left side panel. Panel contents must match larger drawing pane.

Devise a way of hiding one or more event time lines. This could be a
checkbox, but then there would need to be a way of getting it back.


Allow annotation of data set. This is a big feature.
    - Establish a separate data file (and internal structures) to hold
      user modifications and display state.
    - Allow user colouring of individual events.
    - Allow user to add annotations to events. Mark event as having annotation.

In comment display window - add text "enter comment" in gray text if
there is currently no annotation.

Floating event info window - holds same data as scrolling pane
currently does.

Allow loading multiple data sets into one viewer. Add menu item to
clear all events.

Add an overview window/thumbnail that shows the whole event space with
a gray outline of what is being viewed. For bonus points, allow view
rectangle to be dragged to change the view.

Resources have a hardcoded path. Should be relative. Or use .rc file, or compile in.

Finish implementing editable timeline bounds.

How should contexts be displayed?
    - contexts apply to a thread
    - different color for events on that thread and within the context window

BUG - Zoom does not keep timeline centered when the scale is changed.

BUG - horizontal scrolling does not refresh screen correctly.


---- Done ----

BUG - event base line does not draw correctly when zoomed/h-scrolled

BUG - cursors can disappear when panel is scrolled.

BUG - events that extend beyond the window border are not drawn correctly.

Display statistics on a specific event. Num events, min, max, average,
std. Also would be nice to display a event lentgh histogram.

Clicking on event should display some stuff in right pane.
         - event name (based on y-coord)
         - event info (based on x-coord)
            - event start, stop time and duration
            - associated data


Enable re-ordering events. There are icons on toolbar to handle this,
but it is not implemented in the code. Add button to move event to
bottom of list, button for top of list.

Highlight even when clicked on. Make name bold and make a brighter
background (light yellow).

Implement filter controls. Start with filtering out empty events.

Allow right-click on events for drop down menu to allow
      - changing colour of occurrence
      - change colour of whole event
      - edit annotation for occurrence
      - edit annotation for whole event

Writing out the internal program state to be later read in and modified.

Header
        - file level comments
        - file version

Model state.
      - the model needs to be able to be written to a file and read back.
