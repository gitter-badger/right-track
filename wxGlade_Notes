Notes for wxGlade
-----------------

Normally icons are loaded from a file. If the file name string starts
with "code:", then a local symbol can be specified.


Extra code block has the format

<code for header file>
###
<code for source file>


XPM files can be created by gimp. Load image, save as .xpm.
Should make script to convert to .xpm files.
